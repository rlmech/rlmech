## Hi there, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹  
# I'm **Robert Lauv** (he/him), a *first-year* UCI student majoring in Computer Science.  

### About Me  
I enjoy looking at cool websites and was interested in learning how to make them, so I decided to participate in the *UCI ICSSC Projects Fellowship*.  
Maybe by the end I'll have made something cool.
